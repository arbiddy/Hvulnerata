# Hvulnerata
Hetaerina vulnerata ddRADseq processing and analyses

This project was apart of my master's thesis research at Texas Tech University. I was interested in using reduced representation sequencing (ddRADseq) to investigate population structuring and how landscape features impede gene flow, using Hetaerina vulnerata (Canyon Rubyspot damselfly) as a model taxon. In conjunction with the genomic data, I used SDMs to estimate a prior structuring and how historical, current, and future climate projections should affect their distributions. 

Along with the commonly used bioclimatic niche modeling, I also used a Grinnellian niche model approach (included habitat predictors along with bioclimatic). Thus, this project combines neutral population structuring with fine-scale thematic SDMs to elucidate how landscape features isolate these damselflies, as well as potential other similar habitat specialists. 

To get started, I have the Stacks pipeline parameters used for this project in bash script (though I suggest doing it iteratively). After completing the pipeline, I have various scripts in a R script for downstream analyses. Likewise, SDM construction scripts are provided in the same file. 

For any inquiries about this project or approach I used, please contact me at abiddy@uab.edu, as I am the one who maintains and contributes to this project.
