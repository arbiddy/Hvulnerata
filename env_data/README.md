Within this directory are the environmental data layers (ASCII format) that were used for constructing SDMs and for Maximum Likelihood Population Estimation (MLPE) models for Hetaerina vulnerata. 

For Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Mid-Holocene (MH) projections, we used the CCSM general circulation model.

Current environmental layers are split into bioclimatic and Grinnellian niche directories. 

For the future projections, we used the IPSl general cirulation model, with shared socio-economic pathways of 370 and 585.

For the MLPE models, there are two separate directories, akin to the current model directory structure. 

Spatial data for building SDMs are in the main directory (e.g., Hvulnerata_test.csv). Code for model construction can be found in the R file provided, using the kuenm package.
